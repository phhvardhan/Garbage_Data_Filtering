# 🗑️ Garbage Data Filtering

A Python-based machine learning application that filters irrelevant or "garbage" data such as spam, ads, or low-value posts from social media content using multiple classifiers and a GUI interface. The goal is to improve downstream data quality for analysis and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Train and compare multiple classifiers:
  - ✅ Random Forest
  - ✅ Decision Tree
  - ✅ Naive Bayes (Spark)
  - ✅ XGBoost
- TF-IDF vectorization of input text
- GUI-powered interaction via Tkinter
- Word preprocessing using NLTK (stopwords, lemmatization)
- Model evaluation and accuracy comparison
- Easy testing on bulk data (e.g., tweets or posts)

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to install and run the project successfully.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/phhvardhan/garbage_data_filtering.git
cd garbage-data-filtering

### 2️⃣ Set Up the Environment

#### Option A: Using Conda (Recommended)

conda env create -f AOA.yaml
conda activate AOA


#### Option B: Using Pip

pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3️⃣ Download NLTK Resources

After installing dependencies, start a Python shell or notebook and run:

import nltk nltk.download(‘stopwords’) nltk.download(‘wordnet’)


### 4️⃣ Prepare Required Files

Ensure the following files exist:

/data/dataset.csv        # Labeled dataset for training /data/TestData.csv       # Raw/unlabeled test data /models/                 # Models and TF-IDF will be saved here after training


You can manually create the `/models` folder; it will also be auto-populated when models are trained.

## 📦 Running the Application

To launch the application:

python main.py


This will open a GUI window. You can now:
- Train your models
- Evaluate model accuracy
- Load test data
- Submit test predictions

---

## 📊 Dataset Format

Your primary dataset **`dataset.csv`** should follow this format:

tweet,label “This is a spam offer!”,0 “Checkout our new product”,1 “Environment is changing drastically”,2


Label classification:
- `0` — Garbage / Irrelevant
- `1` — Advertisement / Promotional
- `2` — Definite / Relevant

Your test dataset (`TestData.csv`) should only contain tweets (no labels or headers if testing inference).
